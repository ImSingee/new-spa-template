1. Always use pnpm for project management. If you need to add a new dependency, consider adding `-D` flag first.
2. Generate typescript code only, and avoid using any if possible
3. Note: the project is configured with React 19 and tailwind 4. Only generate codes match these versions and never change these versions.
